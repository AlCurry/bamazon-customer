###    Homework 12 - Node JS & mySQL

    Using the inquirer (for terminal prompting) and mysql (for mysql db connectivity) npm packages, 
    create an order fulfillment program in node js that will run against the products table set up 
    and initially populated in schema.sql.

    Products are initially displayed, an ordered entered, and if there is sufficient quantity in the
    database, the cost is printed and the quantity in the database updated to reflect the order.
